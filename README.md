# Uber NYC TLC Data Analysis/Eng8ineering Project

This project aims to perform data analysis and data engineering on the Uber NYC TLC data using Google Cloud Platform services including: Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, VM instances, VPC, Mage Data Pipeline, BigQuery, and Looker Studio.

# Data
The Uber NYC TLC Dataset describes Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
